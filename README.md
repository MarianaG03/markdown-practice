## I'll Share some fun Facts About myself.

 I was Born in New Mexico, I lived there for about seven years before I moved to Illinois.

 ### Here is a list of some of my favorite things to do

 - I like to play the piano! :musical_keyboard:
 - I'm Currently watching Star Wars for the first time (it is very time consuming)
 - I am really into baking as well! :cake:
 - I also help out on film sets in my spare time, I'm a First A/C which means i make sure that the camera is always in focus. I started out acting but i do both because its fun! :movie_camera:

 ~~This reminds me of When I'm Reading a book i like when the author uses the strike through to show what the character might have been thinking.~~
